Basic Usage Pass data from Switch: Override data in Route:  Reactive Data Flow Data is fully reactive. Changes in parent routes automatically propagate to child components: When  is called, all child components automatically receive updated data.  Accessing Data  Via Props (for )  Via  Composable  Data Merging Behavior Data is merged hierarchically with child properties overriding parent properties: - Data from  or  becomes the base for all child routes - Data from  merges with parent data, with child properties taking precedence - Merging is shallow - child properties completely replace parent properties with the same key  Nested Routes Data inheritance works seamlessly with nested routes:  Performance Considerations - Data merging is efficient - uses Vue's  for automatic reactivity - No performance impact for routes without data - Shallow merging keeps overhead minimal  Use Cases - Theme management - Pass theme to all pages - Layout configuration - Different layouts per route - Permissions - User permissions inherited by nested routes - Page metadata - Titles, descriptions, breadcrumbs - Feature flags - Enable/disable features per route See Dynamic Page Titles for a practical example."

The original wouter's minimalist philosophy, hook-based architecture, and elegant simplicity resonated strongly, leading to the creation of this Vue 3 adaptation. This project attempts to bring the same core principles and design philosophy to Vue's ecosystem: - Minimalist approach - Keep it tiny with minimal dependencies - Composition API first - Leverage Vue's reactivity system instead of React hooks - Optional Router - No mandatory top-level component - Familiar API - Similar components and patterns for easy migration - Performance focused - Small bundle size and efficient routing - Path-to-RegExp powered - Uses path-to-regexp for robust route matching with full pattern support - Hierarchical data passing - Pass reactive data down routing tree with automatic merging"

Changes in parent routes automatically propagate to child components: When  is called, all child components automatically receive updated data.  Accessing Data  Via Props (for )  Via  Composable  Data Merging Behavior Data is merged hierarchically with child properties overriding parent properties: - Data from  or  becomes the base for all child routes - Data from  merges with parent data, with child properties taking precedence - Merging is shallow - child properties completely replace parent properties with the same key  Nested Routes Data inheritance works seamlessly with nested routes:  Performance Considerations - Data merging is efficient - uses Vue's  for automatic reactivity - No performance impact for routes without data - Shallow merging keeps overhead minimal  Use Cases - Theme management - Pass theme to all pages - Layout configuration - Different layouts per route - Permissions - User permissions inherited by nested routes - Page metadata - Titles, descriptions, breadcrumbs - Feature flags - Enable/disable features per route See Dynamic Page Titles for a practical example."
